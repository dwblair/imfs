What is the overall perspective on food security?

Island food security
Space food security
Explorers and data collection

all of the decentralized tech

-----

Sorry thinking 'aloud' on bus without laptop -- but this seems like a good rationale for space (among other places) -- it's an arena in which we tend to find visionary work, focused beyond short term. We seek that orientation wherever we can find it. NASA is a good place, SpaceX is a good place for it; also family foundations, subdivisions of USAID, DARPA, innovation centers within big companies -- wherever we find it, we curate it, connect with it, build up network, work together

Visionary urban planners, military planners -- heck, even some preppers

And historical precedents too -- what the US strategy for food security used to be, pre-austerity reaction to financial crisis

So, maybe it's more measured,  as an endorsement of space -- loving the energy and enthusiasm and focus on new technologies for extreme environments that we find in that community -- but only insofar as useful for our mission

Disaster preparedness is another field to leverage

Emergency relief agencies around the world

Natural disaster support orgs

Medical relief orgs

Then you say -- 'including space industry' -- and they're like 'wow, cool, of course'

Yes, that really seems to be another superpower -- the rapid scaling

Because we have relationships with big players, but can also connect with grassroots networks, we can grow an idea no matter the conditions -- around road blocks

I mean, even what we are doing now post-Target folds into that mission / culture origin story beautifully

One idea that came up this weekend is that maybe IMFS is more focused on 'advanced, collaborative tech for food security' -- which includes space, but also any cutting edge related field

The special sauce is being nimble, working with and across diverse communities, leveraging resources

There was a lot of talk at conference about how useful this 'focused, nimble, easy to pivot' approach is for NASA and the big contractors -- and also hoe much they want to embrace open source and sharing

That flexibility means: we can leverage momentum in space community, but also in tech 4 developing world community, and academia, and internationally, etc -- like DARPA, but as if it were a worldwide org, with all of humanity as clients -- doesn't have the military budget, but has the (equally powerful?) advantage of global network

They kept talking about 'stovepiped' programs at conference, and trying to find ways avoiding silos

I love that 'Collaborative' already points to this key strategic / mission element

'Open' strategy doesn't have to be forced on Decode -- but Decode can benefit from being within the collaborative, and vice versa -- each project / subsidiary can evolve its own 'API' into the collaborative, according to internal culture / needs. IMFS can be particularly 'open' in flavor, experimenting with various types of networked solutions, novel business models, etc

Maybe this theme is sort of Just like 'Skyline X'

But boy, 'IMFS' has been playing well at bars and parties. Even among folks I've met in 'New economy', more radical communities

Chemcham equivalents
radio and other decentralized tech
keep track of Gershenfeld's ideas
develop your own explorer's network
Pip, Rawan, Lindsey
Water monitoring, conductivity, spectroscopy, nutrients
What are the deep ideas -- the ones that will sell / convene a community?

IMFS
island food security
decentralized tech
new economy models
water filtering
energy needed for field
power, etc

how to set up off-grid
edge AI
edge computing
backup data
edge medical
edge diagnostics

niche, vis a vis current trends

these will become more and more impiortant for: competitive edge for companies ... survival for fragile communities ... food security for cities, etc
(counter to chris rezendes' manifesto]

IMFS focuses on the 'edge' cases, the 'island' cases

Who are the orgs already doing this?

DARPA
military

edges and islands
edge computing
island computing

Connection with Willow

what's the name for a disconnected cluster?

Island economies
Island medicine
island food seystem
archipelago

edge vs island

connect with RJ on this, and his computer work

find out who the geniuses in food security are now, study with them ... read their work
UVM?  ask RJ ...

Need to make projects networked, across orgs:

mark green
west virgnia, hydrology
akron
pvos
farmhack,
public lab
imfs
nomad/ideo
unh
science metrics
nasa
uae
esa
military
usaid
the food project
berkman (kate coyer, radio)
open water project
colombia
umass amherst

note:  esa's interest is clearly political and inspirational.  

the connection with modes of governance

no longer need permission to move forward on these projects
seattle ... vacouver island ... food security ... space fest

massive architecture

what are the principles of island computing? island food systems? island food security?
what science needs to be done on the edge? 
edge science

personal blook work w/ tests
billionaire adventurer
just: research adenturer

need to devleop street cred 

book

this work on farm, too
in pressure lab
in extremis
'inextremis'

simulated extreme environments
test things in field
most extreme environments (but still safe) 
like NASA does for their projects
a la chris hadfield
risk mitigation
but all for food security
get to 'mil spec' according to need
on our own terms ... dial it in specifically
write up reports as per contractors
design ideas ... they get 'first dibs' before we post to network?
simluated extremes ... allen's pressure tank
underwater communications
start hte project and get others involved
ned ... satellite data ... audio
list out all the areas
channels, areas ... might not be subsiaries, might be > 1

'risk mitigation thorugh design for the extremes'

this is what NASA does, but: we do it collaborative, world-wide

Decoe, illuminate

illuminate does truth
imfs does 'edge design -- design for the edges'

what would be legit examples of this?
field testing
reports
food with every field test (meta)
blood work w/ every field test
collaboration -- this works already
that's an edge right there -- collect our own blood work

capture video and share
andrea ... what are the vid projects to do?
oyster farming + seaweeed farming in extremis
study it, do it
