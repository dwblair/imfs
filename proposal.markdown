Skyline, Inc.

Research, development, consulting, community organizing and business creation around food security.

A DARPA-like, end-state-driven collection of interrelated goals and development paths around total food security in any human habitat.

Skyline convenes the best researchers and entrepreneurs from around the world to develop forward-thinking solutions for food security.

We establish a global community with diverse expertise to work on specific projects that promote total food security, focused on:
- extreme environments (space, desert, ocean, climate change)
- closed-loop systems (minimal resource use, decenralized infrastructure, resilient food systems)
- nutritional analysis and delivery (human nutrition assessment, food nutrition assessment)
- pscyhological well-being and flourishing around food (cultural considerations, preferences, food preferences)

We organize our work to 'solve' food security around different themes / paths, using current and project technologies.  This organization will evolve as new food security challenges arise and as the technological landscape changes, but an initial starting point might look like this.

Different food security scenarios: 

- Context 0: extreme food insecurity. Explorers (space, ocean, etc), soldiers, refugees, famine victims, etc. 
- Context 1: chromic food insecurity. Urban food desert; rural farmer; Antarctic, Lunar, Mars colonists; space stations; ships at sea.  
- Context 2: stable but vulnerable to extreme events. Many cities around the world currently. 
- Context 3: stable.  conditions sufficient to work on thriving, resilience.  
- Context 4: stable, thriving, resilient.

Each context comes with its own set of challenges.  In all contexts, technologies need to be developed to:

- Assess the context:  nutrition assessment (of human, of food), environmental assessment, logistics assessment, etc
- resource procurement
- production
- delivery / logistics

(etc, as we've talked about)

There are various 'pipelines' within Skyline, Inc.  E.g.,

- Decode
- Skyline Farm
- IMFS

--------

Decode is on track to have field trials in the fall. This should continue.  Once field trials are passed, it will be in a place to start taking on customers.

Decode wil require ongoing R&D as it expands into new foods / additional markets.  

Decode will require use of laboratory facilities.  It will be assessing food nutritional content. It will involve hardware development, and designing new instrumentation (to be fully developed by partners).

The expertise built up in Decode will be useful for several other projects:  pollution assessment, soil assessment, analyzing nutritional content of food supplies over time ... even, human nutritional assessment.  

As Decode develops, we want to think about expanding facilities and staff to leverage these capabilities for projects / opportunties that are line with the mission.

And as we 'consult' around food security problems generally, we want to have this growing capacity in place.

So, Decode is the set of scientific and technological expertise and infrastructure necessary to build out the initial Illuminate concept and business, but also anything that would be addressed by these capabilities.

Decode's technology will be useful for all Contexts above; but in particular, it is focusing on Context 2/3 -- food systems around the world that are considered 'stable', but which are vulnerable to extreme events -- e.g. adulterated food in a retail context.

This focus is a good place to begin -- there are resources available in the retail context to support ongoing R&D, and as Decode ramps up, it can expand into other contexts. 

-----
 
Skyline Farm is where we 'field test' ideas, and convene various stakeholders to work together to ideate, evaluate, reconfigure, and plan.  Not just for agriculture -- the large amount of land there, and our permanet presence, means that any built infrastructure can be deployed and tested out.   The biggest value we provide at Skyline is the community we gather there:  actual farmers from the local and from far-away communities, scientists, businesses, govt agencies, etc -- all in the field, at one site, under one 'roof'. 

To truly test the diverse array of ag-tech technologies, space food technologies, etc will require longer field trials, a wide array of crops, a diverse array of environments and locations.  Skyline cannot contain / support all of these on-site.  But it is a central 'launching site' for these deployements.  Some things can be studied on-site / in-house, and done quickly locally without any permission required / logistics. It is also a beautiful location to host gatherings that plan and develop these projects.  

One might imagine establishing the Skyline Farm Institute as a place that people gather periodically to produce plans, reports, agendas, coordinate projects.  

Skyline is focused on contexts 1/2 -- rural farms, urban farms.  Leveraging support from companies that are trying to address this space and who want to test out / prove / get insight from stakeholders around their technologies.  The context can then expand outward.

IMFS

Various solutions for food security in the realm of climate change will emerge, be useful for a time, and be dropped in favor of better solutions.  Same goes for companies, and particular projects.  But if we are going to make the most effificent, effective, and sustainable solutions, for a wide array of environments, significant coordination across projects is required.  Various technologies need to be rendered interoperable and modular in order to achieve resilience, and to allow for rapid evolution of new solutions that can leverage prior-existing infrastructure. It requires systems engineering, systems thinking.  

This is where IMFS comes in.  IMFS is focused on conveneing the global community around the development of open standards, protocols, and system designs that enable food security.

While IMFS is concerned with all aspects and elements of food security, it will begin by focusing on 'Context 0' -- the most extreme food insecurity scenarios.

Much of IMFS' initial work will thus be two-pronged:

- research into the problems, current solutions, and opportunities around food insecurity in the space exploration industry.
- research into " in the food relief / refugee / disaster realm. 

In both contexts, IMFS works with government agencies (space agencies around the world, food aid / food relief agencies) under contract, private entities (space comapnies, NGOs focused on food security), and academic institutions.  Most of intitial phase of work will be 'information gathering and community building' -- building up a consensus around what the big propblems and opportunities are.  Funding can come from SBIRS, contracts with other companies, contracts with governments, etc.

After this initial phase, IMFS will act as a sort of DARPA-like entity -- helping to channel funding from various interested entities (govts, companies, foundations) to various researchers / entrepreneurs to solve specific problems that are in its 'portfolio' and in line with coming up with integrated systems solutions to food security problems.

If solutions emerge that require ongoing development and support, Skyline may decide to take on the resultant projects as ongoing 'businesses' within its ecosystem.  Eventually, these companies can be either built up, or sold off, etc.

------

It's difficult to predict what progress Skyline Farm, Decode, IMFS will make, on what timeframe, in advance -- especially because it may be best to be flexible and open to new project directions and opportunities in each context.

It's also difficult to predict which aspect of the Skyline, Inc. portfolio is going to speak best to which investors / audience.

So, the recommendation is to call the umbrella organization "Skyline, Inc" -- an entity focused on promoting total food security, in all contexts. 

Then, under that umbrella, Decode, Sklyine Farm, and IMFS have their distinct (but also overlapping) areas of focus.  These areas of focus can evolve over time, merge, or become more distinct.
